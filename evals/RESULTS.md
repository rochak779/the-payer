## Notes
- Baseline = keyword matching, the way a simple guardrail works. It shows both failure modes:
  - **Over-asking on harmless words (needless asks):** 11 of the 18 cases that should be approved get an "ask". "Hotel Chocolat" trips the hotel-rating rule, "grocery delivery" reads as an extra cost, "Shop address" trips the genuine-shop rule, and a book marketed as "the perfect gift" is treated as a gift.
  - **Missing paraphrases (wrong approvals):** "All sales final", "No refunds or exchanges" and "Basic fare: no refunds" all pass the "nothing non-refundable" rule, and a present for a nephew or flowers for mum pass the gifts rule. 17 of the 47 cases that should ask or block are approved.
- By category, the baseline is weakest on refund wording (1/8) and gifts (0/8): exactly the judgement rules the research said matter most.
- Hard-rule categories (conflict 6/6, against 7/9) are mostly right because plain code handles amounts, merchants, categories and dates.
